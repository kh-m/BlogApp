# publiBLOG
#### A public blog made available for anyone and everyone to contribute and edit.

I built this **node.js** web app to try out **Semantic UI** for the first time, and to practice using **RESTful routing** with **Express.js**. The blog has data persistence by using a **Mongoose** database hosted on mLab. The web app itself is hosted on Heroku.

### Uses
* Node.js
* Express.js
* Mongoose
* Express-Sanitizer
* RESTful routing
* Semantic-UI
